**NOTE: The contents of this post are generalisations of a hiring director and consultant in the space. It's a long post, but if you're looking to break into the industry or make more money it's worth your time to read it. I work in the US, so things maybe different in other countries.**

I've seen a lot of posts in this thread about how it's very difficult to get into cyber security. I've been a hiring director for cyber security for almost 15 years. I have 13 consultants that report to me now, and my team does consulting for fortune 500 size companies and large scale health care providers.

I've had first hand knowledge of starting salaries and top end salaries for the past 15 or so years and I wanted to share this with people that are either trying to get into the industry or are in the industry but are trying to figure out how to move up. I'm not saying these statements are 100% accurate in every case. I do talk to 10 - 15 CISOs and hiring managers across a wide range of company sizes on a weekly basis. I've been in this role for the last 4 years so that math is pretty easy to do.

You can make VERY good money in cyber security, we're talking Dr. level money when you're in the upper levels. I want to go through the various positions that are most common.

- **** Traditional InfoSec *****

**SoC Anything (Glassdoor range: 36k - 141k)**

First I don't know any SoC related position that's making 141k unless your a Sr. Manager, or maybe in California. Our company does most of our work in the mid-west, so maybe that's why I'm not seeing the higher end of this.

If you want to be a SoC analyst, engineer, whatever where you're parsing through logs and looking at alerts you're not going to be very happy and you won't make much. Unless your in an organization that has a great training program, do your time and get out. At my last company we paid a Jr. SoC analyst any where from 35 - 50k, that was 8 years ago, so adjust for inflation. Maybe you're looking at 55 - 85k now depending on the size of the company.

What I dislike about this position is that the certification cost to job pay ratio isn't very good. If you want to go get a SANS GSEC you're likely looking at $9,000 - $10,000 all in since they've raise their prices.

This is the absolute worst job in the info sec industry IMO when it comes to pay, stress, and quality of life.

Full disclosure I have mentor status in multiple SANS certifications, please don't consider my mentioning of SANS as an advertisement.

**Compliance Auditor (Glassdoor range: 56k - 120k)**

This seems fairly accurate, I've hire several team members who used to work at Deloitte and they were making around 90k a year.

I don't agree with this, but the compliance side of the house seems to make more money from what I've seen in our customer base. When I'm talking to our customers we're seeing salaries from 80 - 130k. This will vary a LOT depending on the industry your in, for example you will generally make more money working for an fin-tech company than you will in a health care company.

The certifications are less expensive to get for compliance and are quite frankly much easier. I have my CISSP and CISA. For some reason these are looked at as "Sr. level" certifications in the industry, I view them as basic and mildly valuable if at all. How I got my CISSP was I purchased the over priced ISC2 book, read it 3 times and took the test. I didn't study for my CISA, if you can pass the CISSP you can pass the CISA. These 2 organizations just want your annual dues and offer very little value IMO.

These positions offer a better pay to stress ration with out question than anything in a SoC.

Again in full disclosure I'm not recommending any of these certifications.

**Sr. Cyber Security Architect (Glassdoor range: 85k - 150k)**

This seems fairly accurate as well, based on my companies hiring rates.

At this point in your career you're likely 5 - 10 years in and you have a solid grasp on various areas if information security. You should understand the basic concepts around networking, firewalls, logging, EDR solutions, policy, process, and compliance with at least one specialty. You will have at least one expert level traditional IT skill as well, Sr Windows Admin, Sr. Linux Admin, or Sr. Network / Firewall admin.

**Penetration Testers (Glassdoor range: 58k - 130k)**

I have never hired for pen-testers, so I don't have first hand experience here. Seems roughly accurate based on friends that are pen-testers or that manage teams of pen-testers.

- **Thinking Outside the Box**

When I talk to people in the info sec community I rarely hear these jobs come up, but there's a LOT of money to be made in these fields.

Pay will vary widely depending on the company you work for. Companies that sell software may have hire pay than companies that sell hardware because the profit margins are higher on software sales. The pay packages are usually broken down into two pieces, a base salary and a bonus or commission.

In order to get into this field you usually need to be some what seasoned with a technology product, and you need to be able to present well in front of a customer. People skills are critical here, if you cannot work with others this isn't a career path for you.

**Technical Pre-sales Engineer (175k - 250k On Target Earnings)**

In this position you should know a product very well, and also be able to present well in front of a customer. You will need to understand the problems the customer is trying to solve, and build a technical solution to solve that problem.

**Delivery Engineer (125k - 250k On Target Earnings)**

Again this will vary widely depending on the company and technology. Right now IAM and PIM/PAM products seem to be in high demand. I've interviewed Sr. Okta engineers that are asking for 250k, it blew my mind... We don't have the budget for that at my company. This allows you to focus in on a specific product or platform, and you will need to work with customers in order to deploy the platform in their environment. More complex technologies to deploy like IAM, PIM/PAM technologies will get you more money.

**Consulting Pre-Sales Engineer (250k - 325k On Target Earnings)**

This is a VERY Sr. role, usually at very large companies. This roll understand many technologies in order to sell transformational deals that would be several millions of dollars in size. This pay range would likely be at large companies that sell software and services where margins support this type of earnings package. This data point is from a personal friend who has this role and Mandiant / FireEye. Significant travel is frequently involved in this roll. One could expect 75% travel to met with large customers face to face. Again you would have to be able to communicate at an executive / board level and manage multi-million dollar sales deals.

- **The Industry**

I see a lot of people saying "no one wants to train", and in some sense your right. If you're looking to get into a SoC roll, there's no financial motive for a business to train you. 9 out of 10 companies would outsource SoC functions if it was cheaper. The majority of customers we are seeing that are actively trying to build SoC teams are in the financial sector (insurance and multi-national banks).

I know pen-testing is cool, but VERY few companies have internal pen-testers. Our energy customers have some internal red / purple teams but very few other companies have their own red teams. This means that your job options will be limited to companies that perform pen-testing as a service.

If a company is preforming pen-testing as a service, that means you're a billable resource. If you're a billable resource again the company will likely not want to train you because it's costing them money to train you and they also cannot bill you out on projects if you're not ready. To them it's a lose / lose scenario.

The same thing is true for forensics, very few companies have in house forensics teams. They have retainer services with companies in the event of a cyber incident. So just like in pen-testing if you're not ready to be billable you likely wont find work.

What almost every company does have is a vulnerability management / patching team. It's boring work and it's usually focused on a specific product, but every company needs this work done.

Many companies need internal compliance employees, and quite frankly you can't break much when you're shuffling paperwork. I've seen a lot of Jr's start here, but you better be able to write good documentation.

- **Good Industries and Bad Industries**

From what I've seen there are a few industries that I would say away from:

>>> **Stay Away From:**

**Manufacturing** (anything non-defense): Manufacturing is all about reducing cost, and guess what info-sec is a cost. STAY AWAY.

**Non-Research Health Care**: General hospitals are under massive pressure to reduce cost, this includes information security. You usually don't see budgets for quality info sec in hospitals. Also, Dr.s will get away with murder.

**Law Firms**: Large law firms may have the budget for good info sec, but the lawyers will override more rational info sec decision making.

**Private Companies**: Private companies are **generally** (note generally) bad in two ways. First they are not publicly traded so they are not regulated, and they are usually smaller in size so their budgets are generally smaller.

>>> **Try to Look For:**

**Financial Companies**: Money is their business and therefor they have a vested interest in protecting their business.

**Anything in Research (Including Healthcare)**: When a companies data is valuable and directly contributes to revenue generation they generally spend more to protect that data.

**Large Software Companies**: If you're working for a software company there is a significant financial impact to them if they experience a cyber incident. Because it impacts their financials and because profit margins are generally good on software, they have the money and the incentive to invest in cyber security.

**Cyber Security Software Companies**: This is an area I don't see a lot of people focusing on. If you know about software development or are a good coder you can go to work for a software cyber security company. This maybe the best spot because you are actually considered someone who helps generate revenue for the business.

- **What You'll Need to do**

**You will need to put in a LOT of work, and you will need to put it into the right areas.**

I personally think many of the online resources are fantastic, hack the box, try hack me, etc. But guess what, no one cares about that's in HR. You'll never get through an HR with a screen shot from hack the box. I'm not saying this is right, but it's the reality of the world.

You're best bet is to hone in on a specific product like Splunk or any widely used industry tool where you can get a free download. Long, long ago, when I was on the infrastructure side, I built a home lab for VMware that I just had to rebuild every 90 days.

Sadly a lot of the information security world revolves around products. If you'd like to know what products are good to learn to look at the Gartner Magic Quadrant for various security tools. If you're not familiar with Gartner it's a consulting firm that businesses look to for product advice. These products are usually used by large companies and therefor you'll likely make more money working there.

I'm not saying it's right that companies don't want to train but it's the truth. Usually, a company is so far behind they need someone to hit the ground running and be effective day one. CISOs are fighting tooth and nail for their budgets until they have a breach and then budget gets opened.

**EDIT: *** What I Look for / What You "Should" Learn *****

A lot of people have been asking what they should learn so I figured I'd share what I look for.

**Networking (good for red and blue teams):** You don't need to go as far as a Cisco CCNA, but you should learn the OSI model very well. It really is the foundation of modern networking.

**Windows (good for red and blue teams):** Windows (including Active Directory, Group Policy, Local Security Policies) most companies run on Windows Active Directory.

**Linux (good for red and blue teams):** I think the certification is pretty bleh, but a Linux+ isn't a bad way to go for this. It will give you the basics, although there's a lot in the certification you'll likely never use.

**Some Useful Scripting Language (A MUST for red teams, good for blue teams):** PowerShell or Python is what I would recommend

**CVSS Scoring:** You should understand CVSS scoring ([https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/)) and how to accurately under stand the risk of a vulnerability. I would look at base score, temporal score, and environmental score. ([https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document))

**CIS Controls (Nice to know for red teams A MUST for blue teams):** Many companies rely in the CIS Critical Security Controls ([https://www.cisecurity.org/controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls)) for guidance on how to harden their environments.

**NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF):** Most organizations in the US will follow NIST, international companies have a tendency to use ISO 27001/27002. At least know the basics of the NIST CSF ([https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/nist-cybersecurity-framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/nist-cybersecurity-framework)) it will start to expose you to what people mean by defense in depth.

**Splunk (Great for blue teams):** I put this on hear because they have a free 50Gb developer license ([https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/personalized-dev-test-licenses.html](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/personalized-dev-test-licenses.html)) which is great for home labs.

**EDIT: *** Training and Education *****

Several people were asking about education, boot camps, etc. I sit on the advisory board for two local colleges in my area. I finished my undergrad in Technology Manager, and my Masters in information Assurance. These opinions are purely based on my experiences with these educational institutes.

I'm not seeing people with bachelors or masters degrees knowing what they need to in order to be successful in the field. From what I'm seeing colleges are out of touch with the industry, and outside of a few teachers who are in the field and teach because they love it, many of the professors aren't current. I don't think many of them have ever actually worked in an information security position.

**1. DO IT AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE!** No one cares what school you went to when you're applying to a job for info sec. I no longer require a college degree. The last person I hired I met here on Reddit. Don't go into debt, do it cheaply.

**2. Start off at a community college:** I took Windows, Cisco / Networking, Linux, and every intro to programming class they had available. These core IT classes set me up for success when it came to info sec.

**3. Have a "Home" Lab:** Having a home lab will be critical, I grew up very poor so I know not everyone has the means for this. Things are MUCH easier today than they used to be because of cloud. Both AWS and MS Azure have a free tier of services you can use to learn:

AWS:

[https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/what-is-free-tier/](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/what-is-free-tier/)

Azure:

[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

I know this is a lot, and it was sort of a brain dump, so please excuse any typos. I don't see a lot of good guidance on this forum from people who actually hire and how have spoken to hundreds of other information security leaders, CISOs, and hiring directors / managers about what they are looking for. You may not like the information here but I believe it is accurate.

Kind regards and best wishes.
