## Basic GDB Commands
- Loading a binary in GDB :
````
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb --quiet ./fibber_bin 
Reading symbols from ./fibber_bin...
(No debugging symbols found in ./fibber_bin)
(gdb) 
````
- Second option : 
````
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb -q
(gdb) file ./fibber_bin 
Reading symbols from ./fibber_bin...
(No debugging symbols found in ./fibber_bin)
(gdb)
````

## run command
- Sample :
````
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./fibber_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./fibber_bin...
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/user/fibber_bin 
First 10 elements of the Fibbonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 [Inferior 1 (process 60848) exited normally]
(gdb)
````
## start command
- Sets a breakpoint on the entry point of the program.
- Sample :
````
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./fibber_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./fibber_bin...
(gdb) start 
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x1189
Starting program: /home/user/fibber_bin 

Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555555189 in main ()
(gdb)
````
## continue command
- Sample :
````
user@ubuntu:~$ gdb ./echo_bin -q
Reading symbols from ./echo_bin...
(gdb) start hi
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x1169
Starting program: /home/user/echo_bin hi

Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x0000555555555169 in main ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
You entered hi for argv[1]
[Inferior 1 (process 60985) exited with code 033]
(gdb)
````
## Breakpoints
````
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x11a9
(gdb) b fibbonacci
Breakpoint 2 at 0x1169
````
- Listing breakpoints
````
(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00000000000011a9 <main>
2       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000001169 <fibbonacci>
(gdb) info b
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00000000000011a9 <main>
2       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000001169 <fibbonacci>
````
- Clearing
````
(gdb) clear *0x00000000000011a9
(gdb) info b
Deleted breakpoint 1 Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
2       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000001169 <fibbonacci>
(gdb) clear fibbonacci
(gdb) info b
Deleted breakpoint 2 No breakpoints or watchpoints.

## Listing src
- `list <function name>` or `list <source file name>:<line number>`
## Assembly
- `disassemble` shows current location at stopped point.
- `disassemble <address or symbol name>` memory specified by address or symbol name.
## Format Specifiers
- ‘**x**’ for he**x**adecimal
- ‘**d**’ for signed **d**ecimal
- ‘**u**’ for **u**nsigned decimal
- ‘**c**’ for ASCII **c**haracters
- ‘**s**’ for a full (presumed-null-terminated) ASCII **s**tring.
## Viewing Registers
- `info registers` default set of registers. Whatever GPRs are set default in Intel and RISC-V.
## Memory Examining
- `x` command supports the /FMT specifier.
- `set` command works for both setting a particular value for memory or register.
```
(gdb) set {char}$sp = 0xFF
(gdb) x/1xg $sp
```
## Stack View
- `display/10xg $rsp` on x86 64-bit.

- `display/10xw $esp` on x86 32-bit.

- `display/10xg $sp` on ARM or RISC-V 64-bit (RV64I).

- `display/10xw $sp` on ARM or RISC-V 32-bit (RV32I/RC32E).
## Stack Backtrace
```
(gdb) bt
#0  fibbonacci (n=0) at ./fibber.c:4
#1  0x0000555555555742 in main () at ./fibber.c:18
```
## Step Instructions
- Step Over
	- `nexti`
- Step In
	- `stepi`
- Step Out
	- `finish`
## Run Until Address (Temp Breakpoint)
- Step forward some number of instructions, but don’t want to set and then delete a breakpoint, or don’t want to count how many instructions it is, you can use the “**`until <address>`**” (short form: **`u`**) command.
