## CPUID
- Another Assembly instruction for feature identification of the CPU.
- [CPUID-Docs](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/cpuid#the-processor-brand-index-method)
## PUSHFQ / POPFQ
- Push and Pop Stack into RFLAGS.
## Processor Execution Modes
![[Pasted image 20250912220115.png]]
### System Management Mode
- Provides a transparent mechanism for implementing platform specific functions such as power management and system security.
- Protects its memory from all other privileged code.
- Activated when CPU enters SMM through interrupt pin 'SMI#'.
### Protected Mode
- Native state of the Processor.
- Directly executes 'Real Address Mode' 8086 software.
- For backwards compatibility, virtual 8086 mode feature exists.
### Long Mode
- Created by AMD for x86-64 extensions.
- Intel calls it IA-32e or Intel64.
## Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
- Provide a way on intel systems to support an ever increasing number of feature flags.
### Naming Caveat
- Prefix "IA32_" (only a prefix).
### RDMSR - Read MSR
- Only be run by the privileged elite in kernel model.
- Output in EDX:EAX.
### WRMSR - Write MSR
- Value in EDX:EAX to MSR specified by ECX.
