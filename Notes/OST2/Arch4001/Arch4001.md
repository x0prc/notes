## Real Mode Execution Environment
- 8086/8088 16-bit Operating Mode
- ![[Pasted image 20251217234852.png]]
## Processor State After Reset
- All registers except EDX reset to 0.
- EDX contains the CPU stepping identification information.
- Base registers are 0 with the exception of CS which is 0xF000.
### CS.BASE + EIP
- CS.BASE is pre-set to 0xFFFF_0000 upon CPU reset/power-up.
- EIP set to 0x0000_FFF0.
- CS.BASE + EIP = 0xFFFF_FFF0.
### Control Registers
- CR2, CR3, CR4 are all 0.
- CR0 is 6000_0010h.
- Protection Enable is 0.
- Page is disabled.
## Real Mode Segmentation
- 20-bit segmented memory access.
- When operating in real-address mode, the default addressing and operand size is 16 bits.
- Address-size override can be used in real mode to enable access to 32 bit addressing.
- Segment Selector is left-shifted 4 bits.
- 16-bit Segment Selector is then added to a 16-bit effective address.
- Addresses can overlap.

## Chipsec 
- Instructions : 
1. Change directory to the chipsec folder with chipsec_util.py in it.
    1. **_If you have a 9 series chipset or older_**: Issue “_python chipsec_util.py pci read 0 0x1f 0 0xD8 2_”.
    2. **_If you have a 100 series chipset or newer_**: Issue “_python chipsec_util.py pci read 0 0x1f 5 0xD8 2_”.  
        This reads 2 bytes from some PCI register we don’t really understand yet. It should show a value of 0xFFCF.
2. Issue “_python chipsec_util.py mem read 0xFFF80000 0x10_”. This is the first 16 bytes of the un-unmappable range, mapping the last 256KB of the BIOS.
3. Issue “_python chipsec_util.py mem read 0xFFF7FFF0 0x10_”. It should show some non-0xFF values. If it shows 0xFFs, you got unlucky, try address 0xFFF6FFF0 or 0xFFF5FFF0 instead.
    1. **_If you have a 9 series chipset or older_**: Issue “_python chipsec_util.py pci write 0 0x1F 0 0xD8 2 0xBFCF_”.
    2. **_If you have a 100 series chipset or newer_**: Issue “_python chipsec_util.py pci write 0 0x1F 5 0xD8 2 0xBFCF_”.  
        This should un-set bit 14 of that register.
4. Optionally re-issue your chipset-specific pci read command from step 1.x to confirm the value was written.
5. Re-issue “_python chipsec_util.py mem read 0xFFF7FFF0 0x10_”. You should now see 0xFFs, because you have disabled the mapping of that memory range to the SPI flash chip that holds the BIOS.
6. Optionally, increase the read data size to 0x20, to see that it really did just cut off access before 0xFFF80000, but that stuff after 0xFFF80000 is still mapped. (Because that mapping can’t be disabled.)
## Memory Map
- On startup the processor is only aware of one memory range.
- The hardware automatically maps the top 512KB of physical addresses space to the last 512KB of SPI flash memory.
- Rest of memory is configured by BIOS.
- ![[Pasted image 20251225222326.png]]
- Physical memory access attempts to get intercepted, and sent to some device.
- Device then decides what a requested address ends up mapping.
- `MOV RAX, 0xF812F007`, `MOV BL, BYTE PTR [RAX]` - PCIe Device MMIO
- ![[Pasted image 20251225222733.png]]
## Variable IO Ports
- Can be relocated to another address.
- Can be set/disabled using Base Address Registers (BARs).
- Very limited port IO Address space, so relocatable/variable ports are preferred.
## Address/Data - Poke/Peek Port Access
- Offset is written to the address (/index/offset) port.
- Next, a value is read from or written to that index from the data port.
- For Poke, IMM8 could be a command or data - that's up to the interpretation by the device.
- Other end contains a black box.
- Port 128 is the typical BIOS Power-On Self Test (POST) code output port.
- Ports 0xCF8/0xCFC are the PCIe IO ports.
- CMOS, Keyboard Controller, PCI all use Address/Data.
- Serial, SMM, Power Management, Reset all use Poke/Peek.
## PCI Evolution
- PCI -> PCI-X (extended) -> PCI Express
- 256 Buses
- 32 Devices
- 8 Functions
- Bus 0 used for intra-CPU functionality on Intel chips.
### Address Spaces
- Configuration Space upto 256 Bytes, MMIO Space, PIO Space
- PCIe Network Interface Card -> PCH -> CPU via DMI on Bus.
- This sets optional Bytes of NIC MMIO space (optional).
	- And for NIC PIO space as well.
### PCIe (express)
- Has a config address space upto 4KBs.
- Buses are connected by Switches here.
- ![[Pasted image 20260102232728.png]]
- DMI is not PCI so form a hardware perspective, the Chipset is not entirely PCI.
- Logically, configured as PCI and configured as such.
- BDFO - Bus, Device, Function, Offset. (config order).
