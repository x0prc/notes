## Real Mode Execution Environment
- 8086/8088 16-bit Operating Mode
- ![[Pasted image 20251217234852.png]]
## Processor State After Reset
- All registers except EDX reset to 0.
- EDX contains the CPU stepping identification information.
- Base registers are 0 with the exception of CS which is 0xF000.
### CS.BASE + EIP
- CS.BASE is pre-set to 0xFFFF_0000 upon CPU reset/power-up.
- EIP set to 0x0000_FFF0.
- CS.BASE + EIP = 0xFFFF_FFF0.
### Control Registers
- CR2, CR3, CR4 are all 0.
- CR0 is 6000_0010h.
- Protection Enable is 0.
- Page is disabled.
## Real Mode Segmentation
- 20-bit segmented memory access.
- When operating in real-address mode, the default addressing and operand size is 16 bits.
- Address-size override can be used in real mode to enable access to 32 bit addressing.
- Segment Selector is left-shifted 4 bits.
- 16-bit Segment Selector is then added to a 16-bit effective address.
- Addresses can overlap.
