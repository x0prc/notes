## Usage
- HDD/SSD Controllers
- Microprocessors
## Instruction Set Architecture
- Abstract model of computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software.

## Data Type Sizes
- “char” = 1 byte
- “short” = 2 bytes (called a “half-word” in RISC-V)
- “int” = 4 bytes (called a “word” in RISC-V)
- “long” = 4 bytes / 32-bits on 32-bit architectures and 8 bytes / 64-bits for 64-bit architectures.
- “long long” = 8 bytes (called a “double-word” in RISC-V)

## Little and Big Endian
- Simply LSB -> Little Endian
- Likewise, MSB -> Big Endian
- Only applies to memory, not registers.
- Also only bytes, not bits.
