This guide outlines how to build a honeytoken-driven two-factor authentication (2FA) system using blockchain smart contracts and a terminal-based CLI for user interaction. The system safeguards sensitive environments by embedding decoy credentials/actions (honeytokens) within the authentication process, with blockchain enforcing validation and alerting upon decoy use.

## 1. **System Overview**

- **Purpose:** Detect and deter unauthorized access by using honeytokens in the 2FA flow, with blockchain smart contracts and cryptographic signing.
    
- **Interface:** Entirely terminal/CLI-based (no web UI).
    
- **Outcome:** Immediate alert and audit log when decoys are accessed.
    
 
## 2. **Architecture**

## Main Components

- **CLI Application:** User-facing tool for authentication (selects and signs options).
    
- **Smart Contract:** Issues authentication challenges, verifies user signatures, and logs results.
    
- **Alert System:** Monitors blockchain events for honeytoken triggers and sends real-time notifications.
    

## 3. **Technology Choices**

- **Smart Contract:** Solidity (Ethereum or compatible chain)
    
- **CLI Language:** Python (`web3.py`, `eth_account`), Node.js (`web3.js`, `ethers.js`), or Rust (optional)
    
- **Wallet Integration:** Hardware wallets, MetaMask CLI, or built-in signing via libraries
    
- **Notifications/Alerts:** Email, chat (Slack, Discord), Webhook, SIEM
    

## 4. **Step-by-Step Implementation**

## Step 1: Smart Contract Design (Solidity)
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html

- **Data Structures:** Maintain real tokens and honeytokens per user address.
    
- **Functions:**
    
    - `issueChallenge(address)`: Returns shuffled array of options (real + decoys).
        
    - `authenticate(bytes32 selectedToken, bytes signature)`: Verifies signature and checks if it’s a honeytoken or legitimate.
        
- **Events:** Emit an alert event for honeytoken selection.
    

## Step 2: CLI App Flow
https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/cli/
## Authentication Process

1. User launches the CLI tool and provides their Ethereum address.
    
2. CLI connects to the smart contract and fetches the current challenge—a randomized option set.
    
3. CLI displays options as a numbered list in the terminal.
    
4. User selects the intended action by its number.
    
5. CLI signs the choice (token) using the user’s private key (through integrated CLI wallet or local keystore).
    
6. The signed token is sent to the smart contract.
    
7. The contract verifies:
    
    - Grants access if authentic.
        
    - Triggers a honeytoken event if a decoy is chosen.
        

## Sample Python CLI Flow

bash

`$ python cli_auth.py --address 0xUSERADDRESS [Options] 1. Continue as Admin 2. Continue as Operator 3. View Logs 4. Restart Server Select option (number): 1 # Signing takes place securely with the user’s key > Sent signed selection to smart contract... > Authentication successful! Welcome. # For honeytoken choice: > ALERT: Decoy option detected—security team notified.`

## Step 3: Alert System Integration

- Monitor contract events (using a Python/Node.js script or cloud function).
    
- On `HoneytokenAlert` event, trigger notifications to admins via:
    
    - Email
        
    - Chat app integration
        
    - Automated ticketing or incident management
        

## Step 4: Security Enhancements

- Encourage hardware wallet or secure signing key setup for CLI users.
    
- Frequently rotate honeytoken sets for unpredictability.
    
- Implement access controls in the CLI to prevent unauthorized script use or tampering.
    

## 5. **Example Directory Structure**

`/cli-honeytoken-2fa   /contracts    HoneytokenAuth.sol  /cli    cli_auth.py  /alerting    monitor_events.py  README.md`

## 6. **Testing & Deployment**

- **Deploy** smart contract on a public testnet (like Goerli).
    
- **Test** with both real and decoy interactions—verify access and real-time alerts.
    
- **Secure** CLI signing process and distributed binaries/scripts to end users.
    

## 7. **Use Cases**

- Cloud/admin console access for critical infrastructure.
    
- High-value financial operations.
    
- Remote shell/VPN entry points.
