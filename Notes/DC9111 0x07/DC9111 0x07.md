    # Binaries
    
    - Searching with Shodan
        - “220” “230 Login Successful” FTP: 21
        - “Android Debug Bridge” “Device” port: 5555
    - Immunity Debugger
        - Search for text strings in executables (Under text slab)
        - Stack Architecture and Buffer Overflow Condition
        - Registers (EBP, ESP, EIP)
            - Extended Base Pointer
            - Extended Stack Pointer
            - Extended Instruction Pointer (called at Termination Pointer)
        - nmap scan for syncbreeze application
        - wireshark scan and python script for vuln ip request for buffer overflow condition
        - check max values to be stored with debugger and python script
        - generate pattern with msf and send it to cause an overflow.
        - buffer overflow max value is stored in EIP register value.
        - check the EIP value match with msf offset.
        - use !mona modules for safe and unsafe DLLs
        - !mona -find “fileaddress”
        - use msfconsole to extract shellcode and convert it to readable format.
        - start a netcat listener at the same port
        - gain a reverse shell in msf through overflow condition
    - Resolution
        - ASLR Bypassing
