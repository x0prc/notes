- Adjustable difficulty

## ==Bad Puzzle==

- Sequential
    - Fastest miner always wins the race.

## ==ASIC Resistance==

- Prevent large manufacturers from dominating the game
    - Memory Hard Puzzles
        - The cost an performance of memory is more stable than for processors.

## ==Proof-of-work==

- Natural Choices :
    - Protein folding ( find a low energy config )
    - Seach for aliens ( find an anomalous region of a signal )
- Challenges:
    - Randomly chosen instances must be hard

- Primecoin
