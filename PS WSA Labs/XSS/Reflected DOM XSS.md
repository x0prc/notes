Reflected DOM vulnerabilities occur when the server-side application processes data from a request and echoes the data in the response.

1. In Burp Suite, go to the Proxy tool and make sure that the Intercept feature is switched on.
2. Back in the lab, go to the target website and use the search bar to search for a random test string, such as `"XSS"`.
3. Return to the Proxy tool in Burp Suite and forward the request.
4. On the Intercept tab, notice that the string is reflected in a JSON response called `search-results`.
5. From the Site Map, open the `searchResults.js` file and notice that the JSON response is used with an `eval()` function call.
6. By experimenting with different search strings, you can identify that the JSON response is escaping quotation marks. However, backslash is not being escaped.
7. To solve this lab, enter the following search term:`\"-alert(1)}//`
