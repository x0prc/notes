## ==**The Bell-La Padula Model**==

- The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, **==where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined.==**
- The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. ==**This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".**==

## ==Biba Model==

- The Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of **==the CIA triad.==**
- This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarised as "no write up, no read down". **==This rule means that subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level.==**

## ==**STRIDE**==

- (**S**poofing identity, **T**ampering with data, **R**epudiation threats, **I**nformation disclosure, **D**enial of Service and **E**levation of privileges).

## ==**PASTA**==

- (**P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis).
